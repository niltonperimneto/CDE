Waking UpThis is what you must do to awaken.Bring yourself to a hypnopompic state, either from an
ongoing dream or by use of your internal clock.  You may
feel unable to move, but you will no longer be dreaming.Now you are ready for real-world readjustment.Roll over.Squint out of one eye.Yawn and rise from your bed.
