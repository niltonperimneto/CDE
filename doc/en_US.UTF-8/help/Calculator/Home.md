&calcname; Help

Use &calcname; to perform a wide variety of scientific,
financial, and logical functions. You operate it in much the same way as
a hand-held calculator, using either the mouse or the keyboard.

You cannot enter functions or data to &calcname; from the computer
keyboard when any
&calcname; help window is present. You can still perform all &calcname;
functions with the mouse. Close the &calcname; help window if you want
to use the computer keyboard to enter &calcname; functions or data.

&calcname; has these features:

Three user-selectable modes: Scientific (default), Financial, and Logical.

Three trigonometric bases when operating in Scientific mode: Degrees
(default),
Radians, or Gradients.

Ten memory registers for storing values. You can store values into the
registers, recall them, and exchange values between a specified register
and the display area.

Four numeric bases: Binary, Octal, Decimal (default), or Hexadecimal.

Four basic arithmetic operations: add (+), subtract (&minus;),
multiply (&times;), and divide (/).

The "Mode Dependent Buttons" change when you
change modes. The
default mode is Scientific, as shown in the figure. SeeChanging
Modesfor information on how to change the &calcname; mode of
operation.

Here's some information to keep in mind as you use &calcname; Help:

Illustrations shown in these help topics were taken from the default CDE
screens. Your screens may be different from the illustrations if you or
your system administrator have customized any of the screens.

A &calcname; control is referred to as a "button" as opposed to a "key."
This is to more easily distinguish between a &calcname; control and its
keyboard equivalent.
