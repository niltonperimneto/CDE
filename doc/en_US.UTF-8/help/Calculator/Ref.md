There are three trigonometric bases:

Degrees (Deg)

Gradient (Grad)

Radians (Rad)

The default trigonometric base for &calcname; is degrees. You can find the
current
mode by checking the label on the fourth option menu button in the mode
line below the

# &calcname; Options Menu
options menu

The &calcname; options menu appears when you click Options in the
&calcname; menubar. It also appears when you click button 3 in the &calcname;
window and on most buttons. Some buttons (Functions, Constants, Accuracy,

# &calcname; Button Functions


&calcname; has a number of buttons, many of which are multi-function. This
topic defines the functions for each button. The buttons are divided into
categories. In the following list click the category you want.
You can get
information on an individual button by choosing On Item in the &calcname;
Help menu. SeeTo Get Help on a Specific Keyfor more information.






















# &calcname; Main Window


The &calcname; main window consists of a menu bar, a display area, a mode
line, and a set of buttons, many of which are multi-function (seeMode-Dependent Buttons).




# Operation Modes


&calcname; has three operation modes:

Scientific (default)

Financial

Logical

You choose modes by clicking the first option menu button below the
display area and choosing the desired mode from the menu.






# Numeric Bases


There are four numeric bases:

Bin(ary) &emdash; &sigspace; The base 2 number system in which values
are expressed as combinations of two digits, 0 and 1.

Oct(al) &emdash; &sigspace; The base 8 number system consisting of the
digits 0 through 7.

Dec(imal) &emdash; &sigspace; The default base 10 numbering system.

Hex(adecimal) &emdash; &sigspace; The base 16 numbering system that consists
of the digits 0 through 9 and the uppercase or lowercase letters A
(equivalent to decimal 10) through 15 (equivalent to decimal 15).

display area and choosing the desired mode from the menu.

The alphabetical buttons A through F are only active when &calcname; is in
Hex mode.








# Display Modes


There are three display modes:

Eng(ineering) &emdash; &sigspace; Uses the mantissa-exponent display
format, but adjusts the mantissa so the exponent is always a multiple
of three. For example, the values 1500, 15000, 150000, and 1500000 are
displayed in Eng notation as 1.50e+3, 15.00e+3, 150.00e+3, and 1.50e+6
respectively.

Fix(ed) &emdash; &sigspace; The default display mode of fixed-point
notation, in which the decimal point has a specified position.

Sci(entific) &emdash; &sigspace; Uses the mantissa-exponent display
format, but adjusts the exponent so the mantissa is always in the form
n.nn. For example, the values 1500, 15000, 150000, and 1500000 are
displayed in Scientific notation as 1.50e+3, 1.50e+4, 1.50e+5, and 1.50e+6,
respectively.

You choose the display mode by clicking the third option menu button below
the display area and choosing the desired mode from the menu.
