there is a corresponding keyboard mnemonic that performs the same function.
To display the mnemonics:

Click the Keys button or press k.

The &calcname; button labels
display both the mnemonic and the function, separated by a &minus; where
necessary. Note that some keyboard mnemonics are uppercase, and some are
lowercase.
# To Set Accuracy

# To View Memory or Financial Registers
memory register

&calcname; has ten memory registers numbered 0 - 9 into which you can store
and retrieve values.

When &calcname; is in Scientific or Logical mode,
choose Memory Registers from the
&calcname; Options menu to view the
contents of these registers.

When &calcname; is in Financial mode, choose Financial Registers from the
Options menu to view
the contents of the financial registers.

ASCII character conversion

Choose ASCII Convert from the &calcname; Options menu. A dialog box appears:

Type the ASCII character for which you want the numeric equivalent value
in the Character field.

Click Apply.

The numeric value of the ASCII character appears in the
&calcname; display window.

For example, if you typed the letter A, the
decimal value is 65. If you have Hexadecimal selected as the numeric base,
the value is 41.

Click Close when you are through.

# To Create a Function


Choose Enter Function from the Options menu. The New Function dialog box
appears:

Type the number for the new function.

To display the number of existing functions, press mouse button 3 on the Functions button in the Calculator. To create a new function, use
the next available number up to a maximum of 10 (numbered 0 through 9).
To modify an existing function, type its number.

If a function already exists for the function number you typed, a
dialog box appears asking whether you want to overwrite the existing
function. Click Confirm to overwrite; Click Cancel to retain the
existing function.

Type a description of the function in the Description field (up to
a maximum of 40 characters).

For example, if you wanted to create a function that would find the
area of a rectangle, you might describe it as "Area of a rectangle."

Type the value for the function.

For example, the function to find the area of a rectangle might
put the values of length and width in memory register 1 and memory
register 2, respectively, and put the result in memory register 3.
The value for the function would then be R1

R2 = S3.

"R" stands for "register" and "S" stands for "store."

# To Calculate Depreciation Using Double-Declining Balance


Use Ddb to calculate the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified
period of time using the double-declining balance method.

Depreciation
functions use the calculator memory registers, not the financial registers.
Certain values must be in
specific memory registers when you use the depreciation functions. For
Ddb, the values and the corresponding
memory registers are:

Memory Register 0 - Amount paid for the asset

Memory Register 1 - Salvage value at the end of useful life

Memory Register 2 - Useful life of the asset

Memory Register 3 - Time period for depreciation allowance
# Example,


Suppose you bought a new printer for $5000 three years ago. The useful
life of the
printer is ten years, and the salvage value at that time is $500. You'd
like to know the depreciation expense for this year, using the
double-declining balance method.

Type 5000.

Click Store and then click 0 to place the amount paid for the printer in
memory register 0.

Type 500.

Click Store and then click 1 to place the salvage value in memory register
1.

Type 10.

Click Store and then click 2 to place the useful life in memory register 2.

Type 3.

Click Store and then click 3 to place the time period (this year) for the
depreciation allowance in memory register 3.

Click Ddb.

The result, 640.00, tells you that the depreciation expense for the third
year is $640.00.
# To Calculate Straight-Line Depreciation


Use Sln to calculate the straight-line depreciation allowance on an asset for
one period.

Depreciation
functions use the calculator memory registers, not the financial registers,
and when using the depreciation functions, certain values must be in
specific memory registers. For Sln, the values and the corresponding
memory registers are:

Memory Register 0 - Amount paid for the asset

Memory Register 1 - Salvage value at the end of useful life

Memory Register 2 - Useful life of the asset
# Example,


Suppose you bought a new printer for $5000 three years ago. The useful
life of the
printer is ten years, and the salvage value at that time is $500. You'd
like to know the yearly depreciation expense using the
straight-line method.

Type 5000.

Click Store and then click 0 to place the amount paid for the printer in
memory register 0.

Type 500.

Click Store and then click 1 to place the salvage value in memory register
1.

Enter 10.

Click Store and then click 2 to place the useful life in memory register 2.

Click Sln.

The result, 450.00, tells you that the yearly depreciation expense
is $450.00.
# To Calculate Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits Depreciation


Use Syd to calculate the sum-of-the-year's-digits depreciation.

Depreciation
functions use the calculator memory registers, not the financial registers,
and when using the depreciation functions, certain values must be in
specific memory registers. For Syd, the values and the corresponding
memory registers are:

Memory Register 0 - Amount paid for the asset

Memory Register 1 - Salvage value at the end of useful life

Memory Register 2 - Useful life of the asset

Memory Register 3 - Time period for depreciation allowance
# Example


Suppose you bought a new printer for $5000 three years ago. The useful
life of the
printer is ten years, and the salvage value at that time is $500. You'd
like to know the yearly depreciation expense for this year, using the
sum-of-the-years'-digits method.

Type 5000.

Click Store and then click 0 to place the amount paid for the printer in
memory register 0.

Enter 500.

Click Store and then click 1 to place the salvage value in memory register
1.

Enter 10.

Click Store and then click 2 to place the useful life in memory register 2.

Enter 3.

Click Syd.

The result, 654.55, tells you that the yearly depreciation expense
for the third year is $654.55.
