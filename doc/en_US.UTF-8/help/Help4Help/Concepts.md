A hyperlink can be a word, phrase, or graphic image. Graphic
hyperlinks are shown with an open-cornered border.

Two format styles are used to identify hyperlinks:

A solid underscore indicates a standard hyperlink that is displayed
in the current window or a new window.
# 


A dashed underscore indicates that the help topic will be displayed
in a smaller pop-up window.

# Execution Hyperlinks


Most hyperlinks display help topics, but a hyperlink can also execute a
command. When you choose an execution hyperlink, the Help System displays
a confirmation dialog box that enables you to choose whether to execute
the command. To change the default behavior, see.

# Help Topic Organization

Help VolumeA help volume is a collection of topics that describe an application or
a particular subject. Typically there is one help volume per application.

Similar to an outline, a volume is a hierarchy of
topics. For example, an application might organize its help using these
categories: Introduction, Tasks and Reference. Each of these in turn
contains more detailed topics.

Home TopicThe top-level topic in a volume is called the home topic. It is
the first topic in a help volume.

Help FamilyA help volume can be assigned to a help family. A family includes one
or more help volumes. This allows several related volumes to be grouped under a
single name.
