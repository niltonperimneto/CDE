# Execution Link Confirmation Dialog Box
Help, Execution Link Confirmation dialog boxhyperlinks, execution link policyexecution link, policy

An execution hyperlink executes a command instead of displaying
a help topic. Because execution links interact with your
system, you can choose how you want the Help System to respond
when an execution link is selected.

The Help System default behavior is to display a confirmation
dialog box.

Execution policy is controlled by the Help dialog widget resourceDtNexecutionPolicy. The default value ishelp_execute_query_unaliased.

To change the default behavior, you add the
execution policy resource to your.Xdefaultsfile for the application you want to change.

The set of resource values is:

* **help_execute_all** 

Executes all execution links without
displaying a confirmation dialog box.
* **help_execute_query_unaliased** 

Displays a dialog box
only for those links which do not have execution aliases defined. An
execution alias is a resource that assigns a name to the command executed
by an execution link.
* **help_execute_query_all** 

Displays a dialog box for all
execution links
* **help_execute_none** 

Disables all execution links, but
displays the execution command in a dialog box

# Example


To disable all execution links within your application, perform
these steps:

Create an.Xdefaultsfile in your home directory or
edit the current.Xdefaultsfile to include this
resource:`application_name`*executionPolicy:help_execute_none

Replaceapplication_namewith the name of the application
you want to change. If you are unsure of the name of the application,
consult your application documentation.

Start the application.

To test your change, choose the application Help menu and display a topic
that contains an execution link.

Before modifying the execution policy for an application's help
volume, carefully review all execution link commands and their interaction
with your system.

&sigspace;
For more information about the Help System execution policy
refer to theHelp System Author's and Programmer's Guide.

# To Change Help Window Colors for an Application


Create an.Xdefaultsfile in your home directory or
edit your current.Xdefaultsfile to include the
resources shown in the following example. The name of the color you
have chosen follows the : (colon) in the resource specification.

Replace`application_name`with the name of the application
you want to change. If you do not know the name of the application,
consult your application documentation.

For a list of available colors, check with
your system administrator or refer to your system documentation.

Start the application.

To check the new colors, choose the application Help menu.
# Example


This entry changes the background and foreground colors of
the topic tree (TocArea) and topic display area (DisplayArea)
for general help (DtHelpDialog) and quick help (DtHelpQuickDialog)
windows.

Because quick help windows do not have a topic tree, theTocAreais omitted in the quick help
window resources.`application_name`*XmDialogShell.DtHelpDialog*DisplayArea.background: blue`application_name`*XmDialogShell.XmDialogShell.DtHelpDialog*DisplayArea.background: blue`application_name`*XmDialogShell.DtHelpDialog*DisplayArea.foreground: goldenrod`application_name`*XmDialogShell.XmDialogShell.DtHelpDialog*DisplayArea.foreground: yellow`application_name`*XmDialogShell.DtHelpDialog*TocArea.background: blue`application_name`*XmDialogShell*XmDialogShell.DtHelpDialog*TocArea.background: blue`application_name`*XmDialogShell.DtHelpDialog*TocArea.foreground: yellow`application_name`*XmDialogShell*XmDialogShell.DtHelpDialog*TocArea.foreground:yellow`application_name`*XmDialogShell.DtHelpQuickDialog*DisplayArea.background: blue`application_name`*XmDialogShell.XmDialogShell.DtHelpQuickDialog*DisplayArea.background: blue`application_name`*XmDialogShell.DtHelpQuickDialog*DisplayArea.foreground: yellow`application_name`*XmDialogShell.XmDialogShell.DtHelpQuickDialog*DisplayArea.foreground: yellow

# To Change Help Window Default Size
help windows, changing default size

You can change the default window size for general help or quick help
windows by modifying resources. The &dquote;rows&dquote; resource
determines window height and the &dquote;columns&dquote; resource sets
the window width. The display font affects window dimensions.

Create an.Xdefaultsfile in your home directory or
edit your current.Xdefaultsfile.

Choose which resources you want to add from the examples which follow.

Replace`application_name`with the name of the application you
want to change and supply new rows and columns values. If you do not know
the name of the application, consult your application documentation.

Start the application.

To check the new window size, choose the application's Help menu. If
you have modified one of the quick help window types, be sure to
choose a topic that is displayed in the type of window you have changed.
# Examples


For all general help windows:`application_name`*DtHelpDialog.rows: 65`application_name`*DtHelpDialog.columns: 45

For all quick help windows:

The Help System uses a quick help window to display
copyright information, glossary terms, definition links, and
Using Help information. This example changes all instances
of quick help windows.`application_name`*DtHelpQuickDialog.rows: 25`application_name`*DtHelpQuickDialog.rows: 25

For quick help windows used to display Using Help and copyright
information:`application_name`*onHelpDialog.rows: 25`application_name`*onHelpDialog.columns: 25

For definition link quick help windows:`application_name`*definitionBox.rows: 10`application_name`*definitionBox.columns: 20
