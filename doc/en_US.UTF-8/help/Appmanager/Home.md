Application Manager Help

Application Manager is a container for the applications and
other tools available on your system.

The top level of Application Manager contains a set of
application groups.

An application group is a special folder containing
the application and, optionally, other useful files such as sample
data files, templates, and "read me" files.

The application groups in your Application Manager are either built in or
have been placed there by your system administrator. They
may be located on your own
system or can be elsewhere in the network.
