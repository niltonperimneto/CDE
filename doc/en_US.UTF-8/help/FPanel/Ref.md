# Deleting and Restoring Various Types of Controls
control:restoringrestoring Front Panel controls

It may be difficult to restore certain types of deleted controls.
The level of difficulty depends on how the control was created, and on its
functionality.

Controls in the Front Panel can be created two ways:

By dragging an icon from File Manager or Application Manager to
an Install Icon control.

These controls are easy to restore--simply
repeat the installation procedure.

By defining the control in a Front Panel configuration file
(see theCommon Desktop Environment Advanced User's and
System Administrator's Guide).
The built-in controls and controls provided by your system
administrator are defined this way.

If you delete a control defined in a configuration file, it you
may be more difficult to restore, since
there may not be an
icon in File Manager or the Application Manager that you can
install.
# Example


Suppose you perform the following procedure:

Add a subpanel to the File Manager control.

Install an icon into the new Home Folder subpanel.

Copy the new control to the Main Panel.

This places the File Manager control in the subpanel, and makes
it possible to delete the control using its pop-up menu.If you delete this control, however, it will&newline;nbe difficult to restore.
