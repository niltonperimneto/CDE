# Printing Help
overview

After you submit a document (print job) for printing, you can use the Print
Manager or Printer Jobs applications to find out about the progress of the
printing. Printer Jobs gives you information about jobs on a single
printer. Print Manager shows all the printers that are on your system.

Print Manager provides an easy way to print files, find print jobs, cancel
print jobs, and look at printer and print job status.






# To Open Print Manager


Click the Print Manager control in from the Personal
Printers subpanel, which you display by clicking on the
arrow control above the Printers control.
# To Open the Printer Jobs Application


There are two ways to open the Printer Jobs Application

Click the Printer control in the Front Panel. This will open
the default printer if you have not copied a printer from the subpanel.
If you have copied a printer from the subpanel, that printer
will be opened instead.

Click a printer icon in the Personal Printers subpanel, which
you display by clicking on the arrow control above the Printers control.
