# To Define the Scope of Searches
search, scope fordefining search scopescope, for search

Scopes provide a way of narrowing your searches. They help reduce the
size of search results lists by restricting them to more meaningful
matches. Specifically, you can use search scopes to limit the books that are
included in a search and the components (such as titles or tables)
that are searched.

The Information Manager provides scopes for searching the current
section, all information libraries, or a single information library.
These predefined search scopes include all types of information, including
titles, body text, examples, indexes, tables and graphics. You can
create custom search scopes to specify the books and types of
information that you routinely include in searches.
# See Also





# To Select a Search Scope
selecting a search scopescope, selecting

When you start a search, the default is to use the last scope you
specified from that search area. The Reading window and the Query Editor
maintain their own default search scopes.

For example, when you start a search from the Reading window, the
Information Manager uses the search scope you used last. If you have not
yet performed a search during this browser session, the Information
Manager uses the current section as the scope for searches from the
Reading window. All Libraries is used as the default scope for
searches from the Query Editor.

You can select a different search scope by using the Search Scope button
at the bottom of the Reading window. Or, you can use the Scope Name
button in the Query Editor.
