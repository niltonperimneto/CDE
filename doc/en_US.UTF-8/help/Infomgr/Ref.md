# How Information Is Organized
information, organization ofinformation library, organization ofinfolibbookcase

When you view information with the Information Manager, you are
looking at an information library (also called
an infolib). An information library is divided into one or more
bookcases. Within each bookcase, you will find
one or more books that contain most of the
elements you would expect to find in a hardcopy book.

Like a hardcopy book, an online book contains
sections that contain mostly text but can include
graphics and tables. The book list for a book shows all the sections in
that book.

You can have multiple information libraries available
on your system.

The following figure illustrates the structure of an
information library.QuickInfo MessagesQuickInfo messages are brief descriptions of window components. As you
move the pointer over a window component, its QuickInfo message appears
in the message area. The message describes the component and how to use
it. For example, if you place the pointer on the Previous Section
(Up-Arrow) button on the Reading window's tool bar, the message area
displays:Go to the previous section in document
