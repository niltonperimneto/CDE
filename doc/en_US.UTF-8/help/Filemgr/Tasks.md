# To Enable Icon Browsing


Files with names that end in.pmor.bmcontain icon drawings. These are
the icons that File Manager uses when it builds icons. By default, you
must open these files to see the drawings they contain. If you enable
icon browsing, File Manager will make the icon for each file look like
whatever drawing is stored inside the file.

Copy the file/usr/dt/examples/types/C/IconBrowse.dtinto your/`HomeDirectory`/.dt/typesfolder.Open Application Manager and double-click Reload
Actions in the Desktop_Tools application group.

The maximum default display area for icons is 32x32 pixels. So, if
a picture file is larger thatn 32x32, the picture will be clipped and
only the top left 32x32 pixels will be shown. You can increase
the size of the display area for icons if you want larger images
to be fully visible. However, a larger display size area will
slow down the opening of folders and icons will be spread
further apart in folder views.
# To Disable Icon Browsing


Remove your personal copy of theIconBrowse.dtfile, then load
the action database again by double-clicking on ReloadApplications.
# To Change Icon Display Area Size


Open a Terminal window and typedtpad ~/.Xdefaults

When the file is displayed, it may be empty or there may be text
already in the file. In either case, add the following four lines
of text to the file:

Dtfile*smallIconWidth:24

Dtfile*smallIconHeight:24

Dtfile*largeIconWidth:38

Dtfile*largeIconHeight:38

When you type in these lines, replace the default numbers at the end of each
line with the new display area size you want.

Select Save from the File menu

Select Close from the File menu

The change will not take effect until to exit the desktop and log back in.

If you should want to return to the default display area size, type
back in the default sizes or just remove the four lines you added, and
then exit and restart the desktop.
