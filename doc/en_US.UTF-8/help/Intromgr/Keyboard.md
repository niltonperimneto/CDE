keyboard shortcuts











Keyboard shortcuts offer a way to accomplish desktop tasks such
as moving and selecting windows and controls, choosing menus, and
navigating in workspaces without the use of your mouse.

When you use the keyboard to navigate on the desktop, note that:

Alt is the same as Extend char on some keyboards.

Return is the same as Enter on some keyboards.

In Style Manager, the Window Behavior setting must be "Click In Window
To Make Active" (this is the default).

For more information, seeTo Change
