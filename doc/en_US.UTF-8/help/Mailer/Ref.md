more headers at once, or decrease the setting to display fewer
headers and make the message view larger.

shows or hides the attachment list at the bottom of Compose windows.

Indent string for Reply Include

specifies the characters that precede each line
of a reply-include message. The default value is "> ".
Tabs are not accepted as indented characters but spaces are acceptable.

Dead Letter Folder

Mailer saves messages you are composing every 10 minutes. These messages
are saved in the folder specifed in the Dead Letter Folder field,
for example: /home/username/dead_letter.
If you are in the middle of composing a message when Mailer crashes,
you can recover a copy of the message from the dead.letter file in this
folder. Your message is also saved to dead.letter whenever you select
Clear from the Compose window Edit menu.

Format Menu Custom Fields

Use this option to add custom header fields to the Format menu
in the Compose window. Your header always containsTo,Subject, andCcfields.
Some useful headers you might want to add are:

* **Bcc** 

Blind Carbon Copy. Sends a "blind copy" to a user
without the knowledge of the users in theToorCclist.
* **Precedence:junk** 

If you use this header, messages the mail
system cannot send will not be bounced back to you.
This is handy if you are sending out a message to a
large alias and do not want to receive notices every
time a message cannot be delivered to an individual.
* **Reply-To** 

If you use this header, the reply
is sent to the email address in the Reply-To header
field (instead of being sent to the sender of the
message). This is handy if you want to forward a
message sent to you by mistake and you want responses
to go to the original sender only.
* **Return-Receipt-To** 

Sending a message with this header gives you
a "return receipt" from the mail system when the
message is successfully delivered to the recipient.


Header Field

The label for a field you want to add to the headers available from the Format menu in the Compose window, for example Receipt.

Default Value

The default entry for a defined header field (for example, Return-Receipt-To).

* **Add** 

Adds the values you typed into the Header Field and
Default Value fields to the Menu Labels scrolling list.
* **Delete** 

Deletes the selected menu label from the scrolling list.
* **Change** 

Changes the selected menu label to the different values
typed in the Header Field and Default Value fields. The
change is reflected in the scrolling list.

of incoming mail messages. (The same sender only receives the message
once in a seven-day period). If a message is received through a public

&newline;&empty;

Update Mailbox State

You can control how frequently your mailbox is updated by
using the slider. The update is used in the event of a system crash.

Show confirmation notices

When this option is selected, a confirmation message is presented
every time you make any editing changes and you attempt to
close or quit. Setting this option off means that any changes you make will
automatically be incorporated without notification.

Use strict MIME character encoding

If you or a correspondent of yours find that messages
are often corrupted or damaged, your standard message transport
may be at fault. Select this option to see if MIME character encoding
solves this problem.

You can select this option if you know that you and the people you
exchange messages with are running a fully compliant MIME package.
If you are uncertain, check with your system administrator.

If you fall into neither of the categories above, leave this option
unselected.

Use network aware mail file locking

Mailer tries to prevent two different instances of itself
from opening the same mail file at the same time through a
technique that detects this access when both instances
of Mailer and the file are all on the same machine.

A network-aware mail file locking protocol is available that uses
ToolTalk to coordinate instances of Mailer running from more
than one machine, or mail files accessed over the network.

Mailer can only change this option when first opening a mail file.
If you change this option when a mail file is open, you are given
three choices:

You can close the current mail file and reopen it, making the new
locking technique take effect immediately.

You can continue editing the current mail file. The new locking
technique will take effect the next time you open a mail file.

You can cancel the Apply and return to setting options.

Ignore host name in address (allnet)Include me when I Reply to All (metoo)

These options determine when your email address gets included
in the To and Cc fields of a Reply to All recipients of a message,
and what form your email address takes.

To include your email address in theToandCcfields of a Reply to All message in the formyourname@hostname, leave allnet (Ignore host name
in address) and metoo (Include me when I Reply to All) unselected.

To remove your email address in the To and Cc fields, select
allnet (Ignore host name in address) but leave metoo (Include me when
I Reply to All) unselected.

To include your email address in the To or Cc fields
(if it would ordinarily appear there) in all the forms it might take,
including your login address (such asyourname@hostname, select metoo
(Include me when I Reply to All).

The allnet (Ignore host name in address) option only applies if the metoo
option (Include me when I Reply to All) is not selected. It determines whether
your email address is recognized in all forms that include your login
address or only in the formyourname@hostname.

Use Local Name

When Use Local Name is selected, the names in the scrolling list are
considered equivalent to your login name.
You can add other names or aliases for which you receive messages.

Set Use Local Name only when metoo (Include me when I "Reply to All")
is`not`set. This option identifies all known occurrences of
local user's name so Mailer can eliminate them in message address.
