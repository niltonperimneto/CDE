Introduction to InternationalizationInternationalizationinternationalizationdefinitionis the designing of computer
systems and applications for users around the world. Such users have different
languages and may have different requirements for the functionality and user
interface of the systems they operate. In spite of these differences, users
want to be able to implement enterprise-wide applications that run at their
sites worldwide. Theseapplication requirementsapplications must be able tointeroperateacross country boundaries, run on a variety of hardware configurations from
multiple vendors, and be localized to meet local users' needs. This open,
distributed computing environment is the reasoning behindCommon Desktop Environmentdescriptioncommon
open software environments. The internationalization technology identified
within this specification provides these benefits to a global market.Overview of InternationalizationMultiple environments may exist within a common open system for support
of different national languages. Each of these nationallocalesdefinitionenvironments
is called alocale,which considers the language, its
characters, fonts, and the customs used to input and format data. The Common
Desktop Environment is fully internationalized such that any application
can run using any locale installed in the system.A locale defines the behavior of a program at run time according to
the language and cultural conventions of a user's geographical area. Throughout
the system,localesbehaviorlocales affect the following:Encoding and processing of text
dataIdentifying the language and encoding of resource
files and their text valuesRendering and layout of text stringsInterchanging text that is used for interclient
text communicationSelecting the input method (which code set will
be generated) and the processing of text dataEncoding and decoding for interclient text communicationBitmap/icon filesActions and file typesUser Interface Definition (UID) filesAn internationalized application contains no code that is dependent
on the user's locale, the characters needed to represent that locale, or
any formats (such as date and currency) that the user expects to see and
interact with. The desktop accomplishes this by separating language- and
culture-dependent information from the application and saving it outside
the application.Figure&numsp;1-1 shows the kinds of information that should be external
to an application to simplify internationalization.Information external to the applicationBy keeping the language- and culture-dependent information separate
from the application source code, the application does not need to be rewritten
or recompiled to be marketed in different countries. Instead, the only requirement
is for the external information to be localized to accommodate local language
and customs.An internationalized application is also adaptable to the requirements
of different native languages, local customs, and character-string encodings.
The process of adapting the operation to a particular native language, local
custom, or string encoding is calledlocalizationdefinitionlocalization.

program source modifications or recompilation.For a quick overview of internationalization, refer toX/Open

from proprietary functions to the new set of standard functions published
by X/Open. Also, there have been different levels of enabling, such as simple
ASCII support, Latin/European support, Asian multibyte support, and Arabic/Hebrew
bidirectional support.The interfaces definedinternationalizationsupported languageswithin the X/Open specification
