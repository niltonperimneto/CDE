Development Environment ConsiderationsThis chapter discusses general information you should know before starting
to use the Common Desktop Environment application program interfaces (APIs).Before you integrate your application into the desktop, you should have
a basic understanding of how the desktop works. Install the Common Desktop
Environment on your platform and familiarize yourself with its features.
For an introduction to the desktop, see theUser's Guideor theDesktop Introductiononline help volume.Common Desktop Environment CharacteristicsThe Common Desktop Environment provides a productive and comfortable
desktop environment for UNIX users. As you develop your application, keep
in mind the experience that the Common Desktop Environment delivers to its
users. Develop your application with the followingguidelinesapplication developmentgoals for desktop look and feelapplication developmentguidelines <$startrange>characteristics
in mind, to help make it a powerful, consistent, and predictable part of
the Common Desktop Environment:Hide the complexities of UNIX.UNIXBecause the Common Desktop Environment targets end users as its primary
customers, providing an application that hides UNIX as much as possible is
a key ingredient to a successful product.Provide a common look and feel.look and feelSuccessful applications in the Common Desktop Environment share look-
and-feel characteristics with other applications on the desktop. Follow the
style and other guidelines (such as the Common Desktop Environment standard
font names) so that your application encompasses the Common Desktop Environment
Motif look and feel.Make applications easy to use.ease of useProvide an easily readable default font size, and provide keyboard
accelerators for mouse-oriented actions. Use the desktop online help component
to integrate a complete Help system into your application. Basic computer
interaction styles should be consistent across platforms wherever possible.Take advantage of desktop integration services.desktopintegration servicesintegrationservices, desktopservices, desktop integrationThe Common Desktop Environment provides a set of desktop integration
services that enable applications to be well-integrated into the desktop.
Users benefit because they do not have to know whether an application is
running on a local machine or somewhere on the network, or which toolkit
(if any) was used to write the application they are running. Provide mechanisms
in your application that enable it to be launched from the desktop and to
communicate with other Common Desktop Environment applications. Use the online
Help system to provide users with quick information. Use drag and drop to
provide users with a more predictable way to use their systems.Design for individual and cultural differences.By following the Common Desktop Environment conventions and policies,
your application will naturally provide for smooth, consistent, and appropriate
customization of:customizationof

libraries are installed. The run-time libraries are in/usr/dt/lib, and they include the directories listed in.To run properly, Common Desktop Environment-based applications require
an environment in which some files from the following run-time directories
are installed:run-timedirectories,
and running applications/etc/dt/*/var/dt/*The following subdirectories of/usr/dt:app-defaultsappconfigbindthelplibYour application should depend on only those run-time filesexplicitlymentioned in the X/Open XCDE standard. It shouldnotdepend on files not mentioned in the standard;
for example,/usr/dt/appconfig/icons. If you build such
dependencies into your application, it should be robust enough to run in
an environment in which such files are missing or have changed.For a listing of the minimum run-time environment required to run a
Common Desktop Environment application, see thedtfilsys(5)man page.The run-time environment includes Common Desktop Environment Motif,
which is Motif 1.2.3 with bug fixes and enhancements.

Window System-based applications that are not compiled with any Common Desktop
Environment libraries run under the desktop window manager (dtwm) similarly to the way they run under the Motif window manager:
they still work. The level of interoperability with the Common Desktop Environment
follows these guidelines.Interoperability of Existing X-Based Applications with the Common

along with makefiles for the programs. It also contains aREADMEfile that describes the demos.The demo whose source is in thetemplatesubdirectory
is a simple drawing program. This demo illustrates the basic structure of
a Common Desktop Environment application that is integrated with the desktop.
It is internationalized and contains all localized components in a separate
subdirectory. You can use the drawing program source as a template for your
application.Man PagesThe Common Desktop Environment man pages reside in/usr/dt/man. To view them using either theman()command
or the desktop man page viewer, you must add/usr/dt/manto theMANPATHenvironment variable. For example, in your~/.dtprofilefile, set:MANPATH = $MANPATH:/usr/dt/manFor a listing of the/usr/dt/mansubdirectories
