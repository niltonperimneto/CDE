Preparing to Buildbook sourcepreparingTools in the Information System Toolkit process a number of
different SGML files to build documents that are displayable in the
Information Manager. This section discusses the files required to
build documents with the Information Manager.information librariesbuildingrequired filesRequired Filesbuild requirementsrequired filesTo build an Information Manager browsable book, you must supply the following:Book Source Document(s)&mdash; These SGML-conforming documents contain the text of the book
and its SGML markup.Table of Contents File&mdash; Each Information Manager book requires a hypertext TOC that
conforms todtinfoTOC.dtd(5).
You can create the hypertext TOC with thedtdocbook2infolib tocgencommand.Style Sheets&mdash;
Style sheets govern the formatting of your books.
In Information Manager, you can specify style sheet
information for both
the on-line and printed output of your books.
Style sheets must conform todtinfoStyle.dtd(5).Bookcase Specification&mdash; The bookcase specification, which conforms todtinfoBook.dtd(5), contains or makes reference
to all of the SGML entities
required by the Information Manager during the build process.
A bookcase specification can be used to build a single book or
a complete Information Manager information library that
contains many books.Creating a Bookcase Specificationdescribes how you can create this document.
An example is shown inExample Bookcase
Specification.Book Sourcebook sourcerequired filesbook sourceAt least one conforming SGML document is required for each book
in your bookcase. A single SGML document may constitute a
complete book or it may be only one of several documents
that make up a complete book.The SGML book source, whether it is one document or several,
includes the text (content) of the book and its SGML markup.
Through the use of entity references, the document source may
also make reference to external text and non-text entities
that reside in separate files or external system units.Entity references cause the specified entities to be embedded
at the reference point in the SGML document.A document type definition (DTD) must be associated with the
SGML document source. The DTD defines the structural
relationships of elements such as titles, paragraphs, lists, tables,
graphics, and so forth.In most cases the DTD resides outside of the SGML document and
is referenced by it, typically in a DOCTYPE declaration at the top of
each SGML-conforming document. See the exampleDOCTYPE Declarationbelow.The figureSGML Document Sourceillustrates the relationship between documents, including hypertext
TOCs, and external entities, that can be used to produce an
Information Manager book.SGML Document SourceAn SGML declaration is required by the SGML parser. It specifies the
character set and SGML delimiters that are valid for the document
instance.dtinfo.decl(5)is the SGML declaration
used by the Information Manager.declarationSGMLSGML declarationThe Information Manager declarationdtinfo.decl(5)cannot be substituted or overridden. Therefore, your DTD's element
declarations must contain the omitted tag minimization parameter
(for example:&ldquo;-o&rdquo; or &ldquo;--&rdquo;) because the Information Manager SGML declaration has
OMITTAG set to YES. For more information,
seeElement Declaration,
inInternational Standards Organization (ISO) 8879.The Information Manager's SGML declarationdtinfo.declis supplied with the Information
Manager and is referenced automatically when you invoke thedtdocbook2infolib build,dtdocbook2infolib

&hellip;SeeRelated Documentationfor a listing of books that describe how to create
SGML-conforming documents.Table of Contentstable of contentsEach book you build as part of an Information Manager
information library is required to have a hypertext table of
contents (TOC). Hypertext links connect the list of section
titles in the TOC with the actual on-line sections to which
those titles refer.required filestable of contentsThe TOC is displayed in the Information Manager as the initial
entry point to a book. It establishes the default linear path of
the book &mdash; the path that a reader would take if he or she
were reading a hard copy version of the book. When a reader selects
(clicks on) a section title in the TOC, the browser traverses
the link and displays the on-line section in a reading window.In the Information Manager, the TOC is also a powerful hypertext
navigation tool with important features that help to orient the
reader spatially within the on-line document. For example,
using information supplied by the TOC, the Information Manager
graphical map is able to display the relative locations of sections
in the book. And, using the TOC, the Information Manager's Book List
window's collapsible book list provides hierarchical information
about the book's structure.In order to set up the hypertext links required in the
TOC, the Information Manager must be able to identify sections
in your document source. This is done through the application
of the Information Manager architectural forms to your book's DTD.Before you can create a TOC for your book, you must apply
Information Manager architectural forms to identify every element
in your DTD that is to be referenced as a section in the TOC.
This enables Information Manager's table of contents generator
to extract the section's title and its unique section ID value.
(SeeTable of Contents Architectural Forms.)Creating a Table of Contentstable of contentscreatingYou use thedtdocbook2infolib tocgencommand to create the
TOCs for each of your books.Running dtdocbook2infolib tocgenHere's an example of usingdtdocbook2infolib tocgento generate a table of contents.
Before runningdtdocbook2infolib tocgen,
ensure that the book&rsquo;s source files:Contain a DTD or include a reference to a DTD to which the
Information Manager architectural forms have been applied.Contain valid SGML markup based on the DTD.The basicdtdocbook2infolib tocgencommand line
for this example is:dtdocbook2infolib tocgen -T/usr/pers-fTOC.file-idasg.toc-title&ldquo;Acoustic Sound Generators&rdquo;pref.sgmch01.sgmch02.sgmch03.sgmappx.sgmwhere-T/usr/persSpecifies the directory in which temporary files are
placed during the build process. The default is to use the
environment variableTMPDIR.
If variableTMPDIRis not set,/usr/tmpis used.-fTOC.fileSpecifies the name of the file to which the output of
thedtdocbook2infolib tocgenprocess is sent.-idasg.tocSpecifies the TOC identifier in the newly created TOC file.
The alphanumeric string value of-id,
in this caseasg.toc, associates the
table of contents file with the specific set of book source files
for which the TOC was generated. You must use a value that is
unique across bookcases in each library.-title&ldquo;Acoustic Sound Generators&rdquo;Specifies the TOC title. The value of-title,
in this case,&ldquo;Acoustic Sound Generators&rdquo;,
becomes the title of the newly created TOC file.The TOC title identifies the table of contents of the book
with which it is associated. This name appears as the title of
the TOC node when viewed in the Information Manager reading window.If you don't use the-titleflag to supply a name,
you may open the TOC file after it is generated and replace the
default string$Title = &ldquo;Table of Contents&rdquo;with the appropriate title.pref.sgmch01.sgmch02.sgmch03.sgmappx.sgmSpecifies the names of the document entities from which the
table of contents section title listing will be generated.The document entities should be entered on the command
line in the order in which their contents should appear in
the on-line book.Thedtdocbook2infolib tocgenprogram validates your
document entities against their DTDs, verifying that the
Information Manager architectural forms have been applied.After successful validation,dtdocbook2infolib tocgenthen extracts the list of section titles and section identifiers
from the book source files and generates the TOC file.If you later add or remove sections in any of the book source files,
you must regenerate the TOC.Using Style Sheetsrequired filesstyle sheetstyle sheetusingStyle sheets control the formatted appearance of your books
in Information Manager. You can use a single style sheet to
specify both the on-line display characteristics of your books
in the Information Manager as well as the printed output
characteristics of your books when printed from the
Information Manager.You can also use a single style sheet to describe how
to format multiple documents within a bookcase, or you can
use multiple style sheets to process different document types
within the same bookcase.The figureHow Multiple Style Sheets
are Usedillustrates how books and sections within books
can use different style sheets.Specifying Style Sheets at Different
Levelsexplains how style sheets can be specified at
the bookcase level, at the book level, and at the section level.Example Bookcase Using Multiple
Style Sheetsshows an example bookcase specification
that uses four style sheets to provide formatting information
for three books.Once you have built an information database, you can use
thedtdocbook2infolib updateInformation Managercommandsdtdocbook2infolib updatecommand to reformat the sections using new style sheet information.
SeeUpdating Style Sheets in Built
Bookcases.For information about creating style sheets,
seeCreating a Style Sheet.How Multiple Style Sheets are UsedAs shown in the illustration, the default style sheetStyle01will be used to format
all books in a bookcase unless a different style sheet is
specified at the book level, or at the section level.
When a style sheet other than the default style sheet is specified,
it is valid only for formatting the specified book or the section
for which it was defined. Processing then continues with the
default style sheet unless a different style sheet is again specified.Defining Style Sheetsstyle sheetdefiningYou must define a default style sheet for every
bookcase in your Information Manager library
(seeCreating a
Bookcase Specification.)Specifying Style Sheets at Different LevelsEach style sheet must have a unique name, specified at the top
of the style sheet document itself. All of the style sheets
used in a bookcase can be defined using entity declarations
at the top of the bookcase specification. Here is an example
of entity declarations for a set of style sheets:[
 &lt;!-- Style sheets -->
 &lt;!ENTITY Style01 SYSTEM &ldquo;InfoMgrRN/style01.sty&rdquo; >
 &lt;!ENTITY Style02 SYSTEM &ldquo;Perl/perl.sty&rdquo; >
 &lt;!ENTITY PrefSty SYSTEM &ldquo;Preface/pref.sty&rdquo; >
 &lt;!ENTITY IDXSty SYSTEM &ldquo;Index/IDX.sty&rdquo; >
 ...............
 ...............

]The declared style sheets are referenced from within the
bookcase specification using entity references.Example Bookcase Using Multiple
Style Sheetsillustrates a complete bookcase specification
with all entity declarations and style sheet entity references.Specifying a Style Sheet at the Bookcase
Levelstyle sheetbookcase levelThe default style sheet is specified at the bookcase level.
Entity references are made to any other style sheets that are
defined for the bookcase.The BOOKCASE element start tag begins the listing of
the bookcase's contents, including the style sheets that
will be used and the SGML document entities that will be processed.The initial bookcase statement<BOOKCASE StyleSheet=style01>namesstyle01as the default style sheet.
After the BOOKCASENAME and BOOKCASEDESC elements are specified,
entity references are made to all style sheet entities that will
be used to format the bookcase's contents. For example:<BOOKCASE StyleSheet=Style01>
 <BOOKCASENAME>INFOMGR</>
 <BOOKCASEDESC>Info Manager Release Notes</>

 <!-- Include the style sheets. -->

 &Style01;
 &Style02;
 &PrefSty;
 &IDXSty;The ampersand and semicolon in each of the entity references:&Style01;,&Style02;,&PrefSty;, and&IDXSty;are the open and close
delimiters for entity references.Specifying a Style Sheet at the Book Levelstyle sheetbook levelThe default style sheet specified by the BOOKCASE element
is used for each book in a bookcase unless a different style
sheet is specified at the book level or at the section level.The BOOK element start tag begins the listing of the book's
contents, and refers to the style sheet that will be used
(if it is different than the default style sheet). For example:</BOOK>

<!-- Perl Manual -->
<BOOK StyleSheet=Style02>This statement specifies thatStyle02will be used to format thePerl ManualSGML source.After the book's source files are processed, the next
BOOK element start tag resets the style sheet to the default
style sheet value specified by the initial BOOKCASE element start tag,
unless another style sheet is specified.Specifying a Style Sheet at the
Section Levelstyle sheetsection levelSection-level style sheets are not specified inside the book
element listing of the bookcase file. Instead, they are specified
in a book's document type definition (DTD) using Information Manager
architectural forms. The Information Manager architectural forms
identify specific section-level elements in a book to which
the formatting characteristics of a specified style sheet
will apply.For related information, see:Creating a Style SheetUnderstanding Architectural FormsExample Bookcase Using Multiple Style SheetsThis is an example of a bookcase specification that defines

&lt;/BOOKCASE>This example bookcase specification conforms to thedtinfoBook.dtddistributed with the Information Manager.Bookcase Specificationbookcase specificationrequired filesbookcase specificationTo build a bookcase into an information library, you use a bookcase
specification to tell the Information Manager tools what to build.In its simplest form, the bookcase specification
contains the bookcase name and bookcase description,
the style sheets that describe the formatting of each book,
and the SUBDOC entity references for the SGML documents
comprising the books.You must use SGML SUBDOC entity declarationsSGMLSUBDOC entity declarationsto include the book documents in the bookcase specification.
The structure of the bookcase specification is defined indtinfoBook.dtd.A general procedure for producing a bookcase specification
is provided in the sectionCreating a Bookcase Specification.The information you need to supply in the bookcase specification includes:Bookcase nameThis name is used by the Information Manager and by the
internal search engine. It must be no longer than eight
alphanumeric characters and it must be unique within the bookcase.Bookcase descriptionThis is a description or synopsis of the book(s) comprising the bookcase.
Typical examples might be:UNIX Administration Guides,
orScientific Papers on Acoustic Sound Generation.One or more style sheetsStyle sheets contain the collection of formatting instructions
that define how an SGML document should be formatted both on-line
and in print. You must identify one style sheet as the default style
sheet for all books in the bookcase specification.You can include style sheets in the bookcase specification
or you can reference them via an entity declaration at the top
of the bookcase specification.
SeeExample Bookcase Specification.To understand how the Information Manager handles multiple style sheets
in a single bookcase specification, seeUsing Style Sheets.For information about creating style sheets,
seeCreating a Style Sheet.One or more booksThe information you need to supply for each book in the
bookcase specification includes:Book titleThe full title of each book in the bookcase.
The length of a book title is technically unlimited.
Optimally however, titles should be no longer than 50 characters in length.Book short titleAn optional abbreviated title for each book.
The short title is used by the Information Manager's search engine.
Technically, the length of the short title is unlimited,
but optimally it should be no more than 20 characters in length.Tab informationTabs are displayed in an Information Manager reading window.
They resemble binder tabs and enable readers to move quickly
to different sections in an on-line book.The tab information you supply in the bookcase specification
includes the names and unique identifiers of sections in a book
that will be available through the browser interface.Tabs are optional and one or more of them may be specified
for each book in the bookcase. The length of the text of each
tab and the number of tabs in a given book is technically unlimited.
However, on-line readability will be improved by using
relatively concise tab names such asContents,Preface,Index, and so forth,
and limiting the number of tabs to be displayed.Table of contents (TOC)Each book defined in the bookcase specification must have a
hypertext TOC that conforms to the Information ManagerdtinfoTOC.dtd.You can use thedtdocbook2infolib tocgencommand
to produce an Information Manager table of contents.
SeeCreating a Table of Contents.Book source documentsThese are the SGML-conforming document entities that make up each book.Because these documents may conform to different DTDs,
you must use SGML SUBDOC entities to pull in the source
information during the build process.The figureBookcase Specificationillustrates the relationship of the bookcase specification and other
documents used to build an information library.Bookcase SpecificationCreating a Bookcase Specificationbookcase specificationcreatingTo create a bookcase specification:Using a text editor such asvi,emacs,
