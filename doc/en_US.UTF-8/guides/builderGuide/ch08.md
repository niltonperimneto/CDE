# Testing Menus, Help, and Connections


Many functions of your interface can be tested without generating code and
making the application. In both Test Shown Modules and Test Project mode, all
build windows except the App Builder primary window are closed, and the
App Builder primary window is inactive except for the Build button and the
Help menu.

If your project is small, you will probably want to test the entire project. If it is
large, you may want to test only selected modules, thus saving the time it takes
to load a large project. In Test Project mode the entire project is available.
Windows that are designated as not visible at startup (as are custom dialogs by
default, for instance) will not be visible.

Seefor instructions if you are going to
use Test Shown Modules.
