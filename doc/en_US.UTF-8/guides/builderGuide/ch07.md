Grouping and Attaching ObjectsIn order to ensure that interface objects maintain consistent spacing
and size relationships, regardless of text changes (including internationalization
changes) and resizing of windows, you may need to group control objects and
to attach objects to each other.This chapter discusses how to group and attach objects for dynamic layout
behavior.objectsgrouping and attaching

attaching objectsGrouping ObjectsAgroupis a collection of objects that can be
treated as a unit. Once the objects in a group are positioned as desired,
the group can be moved, maintaining the relative positioning of the individual
objects. Because groups use dynamic layout for positioning objects, spacing
and alignment in the group are maintained if any of the objects in the group
change size.Seefor a description of the editor and each of its elementsTo Create a GroupgroupscreatingcreatinggroupsSelect the control objects you want to be part
of the group.You can select the objects either in the interface or the Module Browser,
and you can select the objects in whatever manner is most convenient. Seefor instructions.Choose Group from the Layout menu or the pop-up
menu (displayed by pressing mouse button 3 with the cursor in the window
interface or in the Module Browser).A rectangular box will be drawn around the group in the interface,
indicating that the group is selected. Note that Ungroup is active in the
Layout and pop-up menus; this is only true when a group is selected.A new object will be displayed and selected in the Module Browser&mdash;an
object called &ldquo;group&ldquo; (or &ldquo;group2,&ldquo; and so on, if
other groups exist in the module). The group object is the parent of the
objects that comprise the group. Group members cannot be moved independently.
Any attempt to move an object in a group will cause the entire group to move.To Edit Group Propertiesgroupsediting properties of <$startrange>editinggroup properties <$startrange>Group properties, including horizontal or vertical alignment and spacing

the number of rows, and the number of rows will be determined automatically
if you designate the number of columns.Choose a vertical alignment (if either vertical
alignment or row-column layout type was chosen).The choices are align on left edge of objects (the default), align on
colons/labels, align on middle of objects, or align on right edge of objects.Designate vertical spacing (if either vertical
alignment or row-column layout type was chosen).The absolute values are in pixels; 10 is the default.Choose a horizontal alignment (if either horizontal

middle of objects, or align on bottom edge of objects.Designate horizontal spacing (if either horizontal

You will know the group is selected if a box appears around two or more objects.If you can't select a group in the interface or if you want to be sure
to select the right group in an interface with many groups, open the Module
Browser. Groups are shown in the Module Browser by name of group; if you
select the group in the Module Browser, it is also selected in the interface.Choose Ungroup from the Layout menu or the interface
pop-up menu (displayed by pressing mouse button 3 in an interface window).The objects are no longer part of the group. You can now select any
of the objects and move it independently of the other objects.To Create a Border around an Objectbordercreating for single objectobjectscreating border forcreatingborder on objectThe group function can be used to create a border around an individual

Property Editor.Attaching ObjectsattachmentsAttachments (and
groups, which are based on attachments) establish dynamic layout behavior
for objects in the interface. Dynamic layout behavior ensures that objects
will maintain consistent relationships during resize activities. Attachments
enable an internationalized application to work well in a number of locales.All child objects are attached by their top and left edges to the top
and left edge of their parent object, by default. Thus a control pane dropped
on a main window is attached by its left and top edges to the left and top
edges of the main window. Similarly, a button dropped on the control pane
is attached to the control pane.If the parent object is resized in an upward or leftward direction,
the child object moves with the parent, maintaining the distance from the
top and left edge of the parent.If a pane object is dropped on the top or left edge of its parent it
will be attached to that edge with an offset of 0. If it is dropped some
distance to the right and below the left and top edges of its parent, it
will have positive offsets.If a pane object is resized from its right and bottom edges so that
it spans its parent object, it will be attached to the right and bottom edges
of its parent.Attachments EditorUsed to attach objects to each other for layout purposes, the Attachments
Editor is described below.Object TypeAn option menu for choosing the type of object for which you
want to make attachments. Some object types (custom dialog, file selection
dialog, main window) do not have parents and are not included in the menu.ObjectsA scrolling list for selecting the object for which you want
to make attachments.ParentA text field that indicates the parent of the selected object.ChildrenA scrolling list that lists the children of the Parent object.Parent attachments/Attachments in childRadio buttons for displaying the attachments of the parent
of the selected object or the attachments of the children of the selected
object.
