Using Icon EditorIcon Editor is a tool for creating both
bitmap and pixmap image files
for use as icons or backdrops.Icon Editor enables you to create and edit images
in two formats:Icon FormatsFormatDescriptionFile NameX pixmap (XPM)Multicolor images that include static
and dynamic colors*.pmX bitmap (XBM)Two-color images limited to a foreground
and background color (used for black and white icons)*.bmIcon Editor main windowYou create images by selecting drawing tools and colors, and using them
in the work area. As you draw, Icon Editor displays an actual-size copy of
your icon in both formats. You need to consider the two-color version of
the icon even if you are drawing an image for use on color systems, because
icons may revert to two colors if there are not enough free colors available
on the workspace.For information on designing icons, read the Visual Design chapter in
theStyle Guide and Checklist.To Start Icon EditorOpen the Personal Applications subpanel and click
