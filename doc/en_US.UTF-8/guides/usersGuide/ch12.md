Using TerminalA terminal emulator displays a window that allows
you to enter operating system commands, use UNIX commands,
and copy and paste text.terminal emulatordefinitionofIllustrations shown in this chapter were taken from the default CDE
screens. Your screens may be different from the illustrations if you or
your system administrator have customized them.Default Desktop Terminal EmulatorThe default terminal emulator on the desktop isdtterm.
Thedttermterminal emulator emulates that portion of
the VT220 terminal that is consistent with ANSI and ISO standards.default terminal emulatorterminal emulatordefaultThedttermcommand-line prompt is a special character that
is displayed in the left margin of your terminal emulator. It can be a ``%'',
``<`', ``$'', or another special character. A small box or bar, called
acursor, shows where characters will appear
in the window when you type something on the keyboard.dttermterminal emulatorStarting a Terminal WindowTerminalstartingstartingTerminalThere are several ways you can start a Terminal window:From the Front PanelFrom Application ManagerFrom File ManagerFrom the Window menuFrom an existing Terminal windowTo Start a Terminal Window from the Front PanelClick the arrow above the Text Editor control
(or the control that appears as the second one to the left of the workspace
switches) in the Front PanelClick the Terminal control in the Personal Applications
subpanel.The default Terminal window appears.To Start a Terminal Window from Application ManagerClick the Application Manager control on the
Front Panel.Double-click Desktop_Apps to open the Desktop_Apps
group.Double-click the Terminal icon (you may have
to scroll down to see it).To Start a Terminal Window from File ManagerClick the File Manager control on the Front Panel.The File Manager window appears.Choose Open Terminal from the File Manager File
menu.To Start a Terminal Window from the Window MenuChoose New from the Window menu of an existing
Terminal window.An exact replica of the Terminal window appears.To Close a Terminal WindowTypeexitat the command line
and press Return.Or, choose
Exit from the Terminal Window menu.Or, choose Close from the
Window menu (displayed through the button at the upper left of the window
frame).Typingexitat the command line is the preferred
method of closingaTerminal window. The other two methods
don't terminate any background processes you may have started, which can
sometimes cause problems.If you started the Terminal window from a command line, you can stop
it by pressing Control+C in the window from which you started it.TerminalstoppingstartingTerminal <$endrange>Terminalstarting <$endrange>Using a Terminal WindowThe Terminal window provides a means to start other applications, enter
UNIX commands, and copy and paste text between and within windows.To Start Applications in a Terminal WindowType the command to start the application at
the command-line prompt.applicationsstarting in Terminal
windowstartingapplications in Terminal windowTerminalstarting applications in windowThe
general syntax for starting an application is:application[options] &applicationThe application nameoptionsA list of optional information to be
passed to the application&Indicates that the application runs
in the background; that is, you can continue to use the Terminal window while
the application is also runningRefer to the man page or other documentation for each application to
find the command and options to use for that application.ExampleTo start a digital clock from the command line, typexclock -digital &To Enter a CommandType the command and press Return.Examplesenteringcommands in Terminal windowcommandsentering in Terminal windowTerminalentering commands in windowTo obtain a list of the files in the current directory, type:ls [Return]To obtain a list of the files in the current directory and print it
on the default printer, type:ls | lp [Return]To Copy and Paste Textpastingtext in Terminal windowtextcopying in Terminal windowcopyingtext in Terminal windowUse mouse button 1 and drag over the text you
want to move.The text appears highlighted.Release mouse button 1 after all the text you want
is highlighted.The highlighted text is copied to an internal clipboard where it is
kept until another copy occurs. The text is not removed from your original
source.Click mouse button 2 where you want to insert the
text.textpasting in Terminal windowA copy of the contents of the clipboard is pasted
at the location you indicated. You can make additional copies by repeating
the above steps.To Resize the Window ContentsWhen you change the size of a Terminal window, applications running
in the window may not know about the resizing. Use this procedure to resize
the application's output.To resize the window contents, type the following
at the command-line prompt:eval `resize`Terminalresizing windowNote that resize is enclosed within a set of single close quotation
marks rather than double quotation marks.Running dtterm on Another SystemTerminalrunning on another
system <$startrange>You can rundttermon another system through
various commands:The-displayoptionTherlogincommandTheremshcommandUsing the -display Option-displayhost:display[.screen]wherehostThe name of a valid system on the network.displayThe number of the display on the host.screenOptional. The
screen within the display. The default is 0.You can find these values by typingenv, and examining
the DISPLAY line. The terminal emulator is running on your system, but the
window shows on another system.ExampleThe following command starts adttermwindow on the
host computer namedhpcvxdm:dtterm -display hpcvxdm:0 &Using rloginYou can userloginin an existing Terminal window
to log in to a remote host. Once the window is acting as a terminal to the
remote host, you can run applications there, redirecting the display back
to your system if you desire.For example, the following command logs onto a system namedthere, runs the clientxload, and redirects
the display back to your original system. Assume your system is namedhere.rlogin there
xload -display here:0Using remshTheremshcommand starts a shell on a remote host,
performs some client (often starting a terminal emulator on that host), and
redirects the display back to your original system if desired.It has the syntax:remshremote-nclient-displaysystem:display[.screen]where:remoteThe remote host nameclientThe program you want to run on the
remote hostsystem:display[.screen]The host and display on which the results
are to be displayedTheremshcommand is often used when customizing
a menu to access other hosts.Terminalrunning on another system <$endrange>ExampleThe following command runsxloadon the remote host
namedthere, and directs output back to your system,here.remsh there -n /usr/bin/X11/xload -display here:0.0 &Customizing dttermThere are several ways in which you can customizedtterm:Run it with special options,
