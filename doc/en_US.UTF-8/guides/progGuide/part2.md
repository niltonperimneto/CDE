# Recommended Integration


Chapters 2 through 5 describe how to perform the following recommended
integration tasks:

Use standard font aliases so that your application uses the closest matching
font on any desktop-compliant system.

Display and log messages from your application.

Integrate with the Session Manager to preserve the state of the application
at logout.

Implement drag and drop in your application as a direct-manipulation
accelerator for existing functionality.
