Basic Application IntegrationBasic application integration is a set of highly recommended tasks
you should perform.basic integrationdefinitionBasic integration does not involve extensive use of the desktop application
programmer's interface (API). Therefore, it does not provide other interaction
with the desktop, such as drag and drop, session management, ToolTalk&reg;
messaging, and programmatic access to the actions and data typing database.A few of the integration tasks covered in this chapter require source
code modification. They are optional, and are discussed here because they
are closely related to basic integration tasks.Basic Integration FeaturesBasic application integration provides these features for end users:A graphical way to locate and
start your application on the desktopYour application will provide a desktopregistration
packageregistration package, and your installation script will automatically register your
application.Registration creates an application group at the top level of Application
Manager. The application group contains an icon the user double-clicks to
start the application.registrationdefinitionThe ability to recognize and manipulate your application's
data filesYour application will provide data types for its data files.Data typing configures data files to use a unique icon to help users
identify them. The data files also have meaningful desktop behavior. For
example, the user can start your application by double-clicking a data file;
dropping a data file on a desktop printer drop zone prints the file using
the appropriate print command.data typepurpose ofEasy font and color selection using Style ManagerStyle Managerintegrating withYour application will change interface fonts and background, foreground,

system administrator has little or no additional work to do.Easy ongoing administrationAll the desktop's configuration files are gathered in one location.
Furthermore, the application can easily be unregistered if, for example,
the administrator wants to update it or to move it to a different application
server.Organization of Basic Integration InformationMost of the tasks involved in basic integration are also performed by
system administrators who are integrating an existing application into the
desktop. Therefore, most basic integration documentation is located in the
chapter &ldquo;Registering an Application&rdquo; in theCommon
Desktop Environment: Advanced User's and System Administrator's Guide.This chapter guides you to that information and contains additional
information specific to application programmers.Basic Integration TasksThese are the general tasks involved in basic integration:Modify any application resources
that set fonts and colors. This allows users to change the application's
interface fonts and colors using Style Manager.basic integrationsummary of tasksSee the section on modifying font and color resources in the chapter

printers. The desktop printer model provides a graphical way for users to
print and is built on top of the native networking capabilities of the UNIXlpservice.Levels of Printing Integrationprinting integrationbasic integrationprintingThe printing functionality available to the user depends on the level
of integration you use. There are three levels of integration:print integrationlevelsComplete integration. See.You should do complete integration if you have the ability to modify
the application's source code.When you do complete print integration, users can print data files on
various printers by dropping them on printer drop zones (the Front Panel
Printer control and printer icons in Print Manager). Certain other desktop
behaviors are also implemented (see).Partial integration. See.You should do partial integration if you do not have the ability to
modify the application's source code, but you do have the ability to invoke
printing via an action.When you do partial integration, your application provides a subset
of full- integration functionality. For example, by using theLPDESTenvironment variable, your application's printing mechanism will
obtain the print destination from the drop zone.No integration. See.If an application can not supply a print action for its data files,
you should configure the data files to display an error dialog box when users
drop the files on printer drop zones.Complete Print Integrationprint integrationcompleteTo do complete print integration, your application must:Provide a Print actionUse (dereference) the four desktop printing environment
variablesDesktop Printing Environment Variablesprint integrationenvironment variablesenvironment variables,printingTo have fully integrated printing, your application must dereference
the following four environment variables. TheLPDESTvariable
is particularly important. It provides the ability for the user to choose
the print destination by using a particular printer drop zone.
