Command SummaryThis chapter summarizes the command-line options available when the
help commands are run manually in a terminal window.Help System CommandsDesktop actions and data types provided by the Help System enable you
to compile and view run-time help files by clicking a help file icon or choosing
a menu item. However, if you want to select particular command options, you
must enter the command manually in a terminal window or create new actions.Help actions and data types are defined in two files,dthelp.dtanddtdocbook.dt, located in the/usr/dt/appconfig/types/langdirectory.The commands summarized here are:dtDocBookCompiles DocBook source files into
a run-time file.dthelpviewDisplays a help volume, help topic,
text file, or man page.dthelpgenCollects help family files into a new
help volume,index.hv, which contains an entry for each
family file.Processing DocBook Files (dtdocbook)The DocBook software, invoked with thedtdocbookcommand,
compiles your DocBook source files into a run-time help file. You rundtdocbookin the directory where yourvolume.sgmsource file is located.Command Syntaxdtdocbook [command-options] volumeWherecommand-optionsare options entered
before thevolumename.Command Options-cCompress an existing SDL file; assume
an input file name extension of &ldquo;.sdl&rdquo;-dDecompress an existing SDL file; assume
an input file name extension of &ldquo;.sdl&rdquo;-h(Help) Emit a synopsis of thedtdocbookcommand and a list of option to the standard output-lLeave a log file inbasename.log-m(Map) Add additional SDATA and/or character
mapping files-ofileUsefileas the
output file name; do not add any file name extension-rRemove any intermediate files and the
output file; do not complain if none exist-u(Uncompressed) Do not compress the
output file during translation-v(Verbose) Causedtdocbookto generate and display parser messages during processingIf the-coption is specified and the file is already
compressed, the file will be decompressed and recompressed. This action is
useful as a means to verify the integrity of a compressed SDL file.If the-dis specified and the file is already decompressed,
the file will be re-parsed, all precomputations will be performed, and the
file will be re-written. This action is useful as a means to verify the integrity
of an SDL file. It is also useful for forcing a recomputation of the table
of contents, including byte offsets to individual help topics, when such recomputation
is made necessary, for example, by editing the SDL file directly.See Alsodtdocbook(1)
man pageDisplaying Help Topics (dthelpview)Thedthelpviewcommand can be used to display a help
volume, individual help topic, text file, or man page.Command SyntaxThe various ways to invoke Helpview are:dthelpview -helpVolumevolume[ -locationIdid]dthelpview -mandthelpview -manPagemandthelpview -filefilenameWhere:-helpVolumevolumeSpecifies the name of thevolume.sdlfile you want to view. A path name
is not required unless the volume is not in the current directoryandthe volume has not been registered.-locationIdidSpecifies an ID.dthelpviewdisplays the topic that containsid.
If you do not specify an ID, Helpview uses_hometopicby default.-manDisplays a dialog that prompts for
a man page to view, then displays the requested man page.-manPagemanSpecifies that a particular man page
be displayed.-filefilenameSpecifies that a particular text file
be displayed.The defaultvolumeandidcan be set indthelpview's app-defaults file,/usr/dt/app-defaults/C/Dthelpview.See Alsodthelpview(1) man pageGenerating an Index Help Volume (dthelpgen)Thedthelpgenutility creates a special help volume
that enables users to display help volumes registered on their system using
the Front Panel Help Viewer. When a user initially clicks the Help Viewer
control in the Front Panel,dthelpgenis run automatically.
It locates help family files by searching the help search path directories
(local or networked), and then creates an index volume (index.hv) in the user'sHomeDirectory/.dt/help/$DTUSERSESSIONdirectory. Once built, the volume is updated in response to any
of these actions:Add, remove, or modify family files or help
volumesChange theLANGenvironment variableInvoke theReloadAppsactionRundthelpgenmanually in a
terminal windowThe index volume is displayed by clicking the Help Viewer control in
the Front Panel. Or, you can manually rundthelpviewand
supply the index volume name as shown in this command line:dthelpview -h index.hvCommand Syntaxdthelpgen -dir [options]Where:-dirSpecifies the directory in which to place the index volume and
intermediate files. This is a required parameter.Options-generateSpecifies that a new index help volume
should be created even if the family files and help volumes on the system
have not been modified.-filebasenameSpecifies the name of the help volume
and any intermediate files generated bydthelpgen. The
default name isindex.hv.-langSpecifies which language directories
to search for help families and help volumes. If the-langoption is set, it takes precedence over the current value of theLANGenvironment variable.
