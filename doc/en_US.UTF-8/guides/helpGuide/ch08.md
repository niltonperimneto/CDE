Creating and Managing Help Dialog BoxesThis chapter describes the Help dialog widgets and how to create them.Help Dialog Boxescreatinghelp dialog boxesmanaging help dialog boxesdialog boxescreating and managingdialog boxesquick helpdialog boxesgeneral helpgeneral
help dialog boxfeaturesFor application programmers, the Help System provides a programming
library that adds help dialog boxes to any Motif application. The library
provides two types of help dialog boxes:General help dialogshave a menu bar, a topic tree, and a help topic display area.
The topic tree lists the help volume's topics and subtopics. Users use the
topic tree to select topics to view, to browse available topics, and to locate
where they are in the help volume.Quick help dialogscontain
a topic display area and one or more dialog buttons at the bottom.Standard Xt Paradigmwidget classesclass, dialog widgetswidget resourcesresourceshelp dialog boxesIn
terms of programming, you interact with the help dialogs the same as you
do with any other Motif widgets in your applications. The two types of
help dialog boxes are defined as two new widget classes:DtHelpDialogandDtHelpQuickDialog.Nearly every attribute of the help windows&mdash;including the volume
name and topic ID&mdash;are manipulated as widget resources. For instance,
to display a new topic, you just execute anXtSetValues()call to set theDtNhelpVolume,DtNlocationId, andDtNhelpTyperesources. For more information, refer to.Integrating the Help System into an application requires a working
knowledge of the C programming language, the Motif programmer's toolkit,
and the Xt Intrinsics toolkit.General Help DialogA general help dialog has two display areas: the topic tree and topic
display area. The topic tree provides a scrollable list of help topics. The
home topic title is always the first item. When a user chooses a title, an
arrow (&rarr;) marks the title and its help information is displayed in the topic
display area.shows the topic tree and topic display area of a general help window. The
current topic, &ldquo;To select a palette&rdquo;, is displayed.The general help dialog includes three dialog buttons: Backtrack, History,
and Index. These commands are also available in the Help menus. For an overview
of the Help dialogs and the graphical user interface, refer to the section,.general help dialog boxfeaturesgeneral help dialog boxdialog buttonsdialog

the Close command.ExampleThe following code segment creates a general help dialog (as a child
ofparent) using the convenience function.
The dialog is left unmanaged&mdash;presumably it is managed elsewhere in the
application when a help request is made.Widget   mainHelpDialog, moreButton, helpButton;
ac = 0;
XtSetArg (al[ac], XmNtitle,  "My Application - Help");  ac++;
XtSetArg (al[ac], DtNhelpVolume,  "My Help Volume");  ac++;
XtSetArg (al[ac], DtNlocationId,  "Getting Started");  ac++;
XtSetArg (al[ac], DtNhelpType,  "DtHELP_TYPE_TOPIC");  ac++;
mainHelpDialog =
  DtCreateHelpDialog (parent, "mainHelpDialog", al, ac);The following two calls add the hyperlink and close callbacks to the
dialog. Presumably, the functionsHyperlinkCB()andCloseHelpCB()are declared elsewhere in the application.XtAddCallback (mainHelpDialog, DtNhyperLinkCallback,
                        HyperlinkCB, (XtPointer)NULL);
XtAddCallback (mainHelpDialog, DtNcloseCallback,
               CloseHelpCB, (XtPointer)NULL);See AlsoDtCreateHelpDialog(3) man pageDtHelpDialog(3)
man pageQuick Help Dialogquick help dialog boxbuttonsThe quick help dialog box is designed to help you
meet the primary objective of online help:Get the user back on
task as quickly and successfully as possible.This simple user
interface helps keep the user focused on the information. The information
should be useful enough that the user dismisses the dialog after reading it
and continues working.Quick help dialog with four standard buttonsThe quick help dialog has five buttons, four of which are managed. The
remaining dialog button is configurable, so this button can be used for anything.
However, its intended purpose is to provide a path to more help in one of
these two ways:Let the user ask for more detailed information.
In this case, the default button label (More) is appropriate. This is calledprogressive disclosure.Let the user open a general help dialog for general
browsing of the application's help volume. In this case,Browse&hellip;is the most appropriate button label.The Developer's toolkit includes a convenience function,DtHelpQuickDialogGetChild(), for determining the widget ID for
any of the quick help dialog buttons.To Create a Quick Help DialogInclude the appropriate header files:#include <Help.h>
#include <HelpQuickD.h>Create an instance of the quick help dialog widget:Use theDtCreateHelpQuickDialog()convenience function.Or,use theXtCreateManagedWidget()function.Add a callback for handling hyperlink events that
occur within the dialog. (For more information, see.)Add aclose callbackfor handling
the OK button.Configure the dialog buttons that you want to use:If you intend to use the application-configured
button, manage it and add an activate callback.If you want to disallow printing, unmanage the
Print button.Manage the Help button and add ahelp
callbackto the dialog to allow the user to get &ldquo;help on
help.&rdquo;ExampleThe following code segment creates a quick help dialog (as a child ofparent) using the convenience function. The dialog is left unmanaged;
presumably, it is managed elsewhere in the application when a help request
is made. In this example, the application-configured button is enabled and
used to request more help.Widget   quickHelpDialog, moreButton, helpButton;
ac = 0;
XtSetArg (al[ac], XmNtitle,  "My Application - Help");  ac++;
XtSetArg (al[ac], DtNhelpVolume,  "My Help Volume");  ac++;
XtSetArg (al[ac], DtNlocationId,  "Getting Started");  ac++;
XtSetArg (al[ac], DtNhelpType,  "DtHELP;_TYPE_TOPIC"); ac++;

quickHelpDialog =
  DtCreateHelpQuickDialog (parent, "quickHelpDialog", al, ac);The following two calls add the hyperlink and close callbacks to the
dialog. Presumably, the functionsHyperlinkCB()andCloseHelpCB()are declared elsewhere in the application.XtAddCallback (quickHelpDialog, DtNhyperLinkCallback,
               HyperlinkCB, (XtPointer)NULL);
XtAddCallback (quickHelpDialog, DtNcloseCallback,
               CloseHelpCB, (XtPointer)NULL);Here, the application-configured button is managed and assigned an activate
callback that invokes the application'sMoreHelpCB()function.moreButton = DtHelpQuickDialogGetChild (quickHelpDialog,
                             DT_HELP_QUICK_MORE_BUTTON);
XtManageChild (moreButton);
XtAddCallback (moreButton, XmNactivateCallback,
               MoreHelpCB, (XtPointer)NULL);To provide &ldquo;help on help,&rdquo; the dialog's Help button is managed
and a help callback is added to the dialog.helpButton = DtHelpQuickDialogGetChild (quickHelpDialog,
                             DT_HELP_QUICK_HELP_BUTTON);
XtManageChild (helpButton);
XtAddCallback (quickHelpDialog,DtNhelpCallback,
               HelpRequestCB, USING_HELP);Like other Motif dialogs, when you add a help callback to a quick
help dialog, it is used by both the F1 key and the Help button.See AlsoDtCreateHelpQuickDialog(3) man pageDtHelpQuickDialog(3) man pageDtHelpQuickDialogGetChild(3) man pageSummary of Application Program InterfaceRelated man pages for the Help System are:Functions for creating and working with dialogs:DtHelp(5)DtHelpDialog(5)DtHelpQuickD(5)DtCreateHelpDialog()DtCreateHelpQUickDialog()DtHelpQuickDialogGetChild()Function for implementing item help mode:DtHelpReturnSelectedWidgetId()Function for specifying the message catalog for
