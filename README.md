It is a fork of the Commond Desktop Enviroment hosted on SourceForge

The purpose to this fork on Github is to iterate on the Arch Linux support and build.
Commits are welcomed and they will be submitted to upstream if authorized
It should be the groundwork of making an Arch User Repository (AUR) with the explicit purpose of being Arch Linux first

Maybe the scope of this fork widens in the future if there's time and interest, but for now it will be kept simple.
